# 🩺 Diabetes EDA and Detection

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and building a **Machine Learning model** to detect the presence of **diabetes** based on health-related attributes.  
The goal is to understand the patterns and relationships within the dataset and develop a predictive system that can assist healthcare providers in early diabetes detection.

## 📊 Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Handled missing and zero values.
   - Corrected inconsistencies in the data.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Analyzed feature distributions and relationships.
   - Visualized correlations between features using heatmaps and pair plots.

3. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Evaluated feature importance.
   - Standardized and scaled data where necessary.

4. **Model Building:**  
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Built and evaluated multiple models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
   - Selected the best-performing model based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. **Model Evaluation:**  
   - Used classification metrics and confusion matrix.
   - Fine-tuned the model for optimal performance.

## 🚀 Results

- Achieved a **high accuracy rate** in predicting diabetes outcomes.
- Identified key features that significantly influence diabetes diagnosis, such as **Glucose** and **BMI** levels.

---

## 🎯 Key Insights

- Higher glucose levels and BMI are strong indicators of diabetes.
- Early feature analysis can provide critical warning signs even before a formal diagnosis.

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

- Explore advanced models such as XGBoost or Neural Networks.
- Deploy the model into a simple web application for real-time predictions.
- Expand analysis using larger and more diverse healthcare datasets.
