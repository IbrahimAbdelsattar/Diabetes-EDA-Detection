Age**\n- **Description**: Age of the patient in years, ranging from **0.08 to 80**.\n- **Significance**: Risk of diabetes increases with age, particularly for Type 2 diabetes. The mean age is approximately **41.79 years**.\n\n---\n\n### üöª **2. Gender**\n- **Description**: Biological sex of the individual ‚Äî **Male**, **Female**, or **Other**.\n- **Significance**: Gender can influence diabetes susceptibility due to differences in hormones, body composition, and lifestyle factors. The dataset includes **Male: 39,537** and **Female: 55,262**.\n\n---\n\n### ‚öñÔ∏è **3. Body Mass Index (BMI)**\n- **Description**: A measure of body fat based on height and weight, with values in the dataset ranging from **10.16 to 71.55**.\n- **Categories**:\n  - Underweight: < 18.5  \n  - Normal weight: 18.5 ‚Äì 24.9  \n  - Overweight: 25 ‚Äì 29.9  \n  - Obese: ‚â• 30  \n- **Significance**: A higher BMI increases the likelihood of developing Type 2 diabetes. The most common value in the dataset is **27.32** (Overweight).\n\n---\n\n### ‚ù§Ô∏è **4. Hypertension**\n- **Description**: Indicates if a patient has high blood pressure ‚Äî **0 = No**, **1 = Yes**.\n- **Distribution**: **0: 87,482**, **1: 7,317**\n- **Significance**: Hypertension often coexists with diabetes and is linked to insulin resistance.\n\n---\n\n### üíî **5. Heart Disease**\n- **Description**: Indicates if the patient has any form of heart disease ‚Äî **0 = No**, **1 = Yes**.\n- **Distribution**: **0: 90,907**, **1: 3,892**\n- **Significance**: Heart disease is both a complication and a risk factor for diabetes.\n\n---\n\n### üö¨ **6. Smoking History**\n- **Description**: Smoking status of the patient.\n- **Categories & Counts**:\n  - Never: 34,011  \n  - No Info: 32,242  \n  - Former: 9,176  \n  - Current: 9,109  \n  - Not Current: 6,299  \n  - Ever: 3,962  \n- **Significance**: Smoking is known to contribute to insulin resistance and other metabolic issues that increase diabetes risk.\n\n---\n\n### üß™ **7. HbA1c Level**\n- **Description**: Reflects the average blood sugar level over the past 2‚Äì3 months.\n- **Significance**: An HbA1c level of **6.5% or more** typically indicates diabetes. Values in the dataset range from **3.5 to 9.0**, with common values being **6.6, 5.7, 6.5, and 6.0**.\n\n---\n\n### üíâ **8. Blood Glucose Level**\n- **Description**: The current level of glucose in the blood.\n- **Significance**: A crucial diagnostic marker ‚Äî normal fasting blood glucose is generally between **70‚Äì130 mg/dL**. Values above **250** are considered very high and potentially dangerous. The dataset contains values from **80 to 300**, with common values like **159, 130, 126, and 140**.\n\n---\n\n### üéØ **9. Diabetes**\n- **Description**: Target variable ‚Äî **0 = No Diabetes**, **1 = Has Diabetes**\n- **Significance**: This is the outcome we're trying to predict based on the above features using machine learning models.\n\n---","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Show how many columns and

These numerical features provide insights into the physical health characteristics of individuals, and understanding how they correlate with **diabetes status** is crucial for identifying risk factors and developing predictive models for diabetes.\n\n### Numerical Features Analyzed\nThe following numerical features are considered in this analysis:\n- **Age**: The age of the individuals in years.\n- **BMI (Body Mass Index)**: A measure of body fat based on height and weight.\n- **HbA1c Level**: The average blood sugar levels over the past 2-3 months.\n- **Blood Glucose Level**: The fasting blood glucose concentration.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Age vs Diabetes Status**\n\n#### Boxplot Analysis:\nWe observe how the **Age** distribution varies between **diabetic** and **non-diabetic** groups. The boxplot visualizes the median, interquartile range, and potential outliers for both groups. Generally, the **diabetic** group tends to have a slightly higher median age than the **non-diabetic** group.\n\n#### Summary Statistics:\n- **Mean Age**: Diabetic individuals tend to be older on average compared to non-diabetic individuals. This aligns with known trends, as the likelihood of developing **type 2 diabetes** increases with age.\n\n#### Benefit:\nBy analyzing **Age** against **diabetes status**, we can identify the **age groups** most at risk for developing diabetes, enabling healthcare providers to target preventive measures for specific age ranges.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **BMI vs Diabetes Status**\n\n#### Boxplot Analysis:\nThe **BMI** distribution shows that individuals with **higher BMI** tend to be more likely to be diabetic. The **diabetic** group generally has a higher **BMI** compared to the **non-diabetic** group, particularly in the **overweight** and **obese** ranges.\n\n#### Summary Statistics:\n- **Mean BMI**: Diabetic individuals typically have a BMI above the **normal range**, which is consistent with known associations between **obesity** and **diabetes** risk. Higher BMI values correlate with an increased risk of **type 2 diabetes**.\n\n#### Benefit:\nBy understanding the relationship between **BMI** and diabetes, we can pinpoint **obesity** as a significant risk factor and help prioritize **weight management** interventions for at-risk populations.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **HbA1c Level vs Diabetes Status**\n\n#### Boxplot Analysis:\nThe **HbA1c Level** is a key marker for blood glucose control. The **diabetic** group consistently shows higher **HbA1c levels** compared to the **non-diabetic** group. A higher **HbA1c** indicates **poor blood sugar control** or the presence of **diabetes**.\n\n#### Summary Statistics:\n- **Mean HbA1c**: Diabetic individuals show an **HbA1c level** above the **6.5% threshold**, which is the diagnostic criteria for diabetes.\n\n#### Benefit:\nThis analysis emphasizes the critical role of **HbA1c testing** in **diagnosing and monitoring diabetes**. By identifying individuals with higher HbA1c values, we can provide more targeted **medical interventions** and **lifestyle recommendations** to manage blood glucose levels.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Blood Glucose Level vs Diabetes Status**\n\n#### Boxplot Analysis:\n**Blood Glucose Levels** show a noticeable difference between the two groups. The **diabetic** group exhibits higher **fasting blood glucose levels**, with some individuals showing levels well above the **normal range** of **100 mg/dL**.\n\n#### Summary Statistics:\n- **Mean Blood Glucose Level**: Diabetic individuals typically have higher fasting glucose concentrations, which is consistent with the **diagnosis of diabetes** based on fasting blood glucose criteria (‚â•126 mg/dL).\n\n#### Benefit:\nThis feature is invaluable in **early detection of diabetes**. Monitoring blood glucose levels allows for **timely intervention** and **prevention** of complications such as heart disease and kidney failure associated with uncontrolled diabetes.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Age, BMI, HbA1c Level, and Blood Glucose Level** all show significant differences between **diabetic** and **non-diabetic** individuals.\n- **Age** and **BMI** appear to be important risk factors for diabetes, with older age and higher BMI correlating with higher diabetes prevalence.\n- **HbA1c Level** and **Blood Glucose Level** are key indicators for diabetes diagnosis and management.\n- By leveraging these features, we can develop more accurate **predictive models** for diabetes risk and inform **preventive healthcare strategies**.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\nThe bivariate analysis of numerical features provides valuable insights into how various health metrics influence the likelihood of developing **diabetes**.

Understanding these relationships helps identify key risk factors and guides the development of targeted interventions to prevent or manage diabetes.\n\n### Categorical Features Analyzed\nThe following categorical features are considered in this analysis:\n- **Gender**: The sex of the individuals (Male, Female).\n- **Smoking History**: The smoking status of the individuals (e.g., Never, Former, Current, No Info).\n- **Hypertension**: Whether the individual has hypertension (0 for No, 1 for Yes).\n- **Heart Disease**: Whether the individual has heart disease (0 for No, 1 for Yes).\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Gender vs Diabetes Status**\n\n#### Count Plot Analysis:\nThe **Gender** distribution between **diabetic** and **non-diabetic** individuals is analyzed through a **count plot**. This visualizes the number of males and females in both groups.\n\n#### Summary:\n- The dataset contains a higher number of **female** individuals (55,262) compared to **male** individuals (39,537).\n- The diabetes prevalence might differ slightly between the genders, but the count plot will give insights into whether gender influences diabetes risk.\n\n#### Benefit:\nThis analysis can help healthcare providers understand if **gender** plays a significant role in diabetes risk. Knowing the distribution of diabetes cases across gender groups could guide gender-specific interventions or awareness campaigns.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Smoking History vs Diabetes Status**\n\n#### Count Plot Analysis:\nWe analyze how different categories of **Smoking History** (e.g., Never, Former, Current, No Info) are distributed across **diabetic** and **non-diabetic** groups using a **count plot**.\n\n#### Summary:\n- **Never smoked**: 34,011 individuals.\n- **No Info**: 32,242 individuals.\n- **Former smokers**: 9,176 individuals.\n- **Current smokers**: 9,109 individuals.\n- **Not current**: 6,299 individuals.\n- **Ever smoked**: 3,962 individuals.\n\n#### Benefit:\nThis analysis reveals the association between **smoking history** and diabetes status. Smoking is a known risk factor for **type 2 diabetes**, and analyzing this feature will help identify individuals who might benefit from smoking cessation programs as part of **diabetes prevention** strategies.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Hypertension vs Diabetes Status**\n\n#### Count Plot Analysis:\nThe **Hypertension** feature (binary: 0 for No, 1 for Yes) is analyzed to see how the presence of hypertension correlates with diabetes status. \n\n#### Summary:\n- **Hypertension (0)**: 87,482 individuals.\n- **Hypertension (1)**: 7,317 individuals.\n\n#### Benefit:\nHypertension is a major **cardiovascular risk factor** and is strongly associated with an increased risk of **diabetes**. By analyzing this feature, we can identify individuals who have both conditions and implement strategies for **joint management** of hypertension and diabetes. Early intervention in hypertensive individuals could potentially help prevent the onset of **diabetes**.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Heart Disease vs Diabetes Status**\n\n#### Count Plot Analysis:\nWe examine the relationship between the presence of **Heart Disease** (binary: 0 for No, 1 for Yes) and diabetes status through a **count plot**.\n\n#### Summary:\n- **No Heart Disease (0)**: 90,907 individuals.\n- **Heart Disease (1)**: 3,892 individuals.\n\n#### Benefit:\nThe presence of **heart disease** increases the likelihood of developing **type 2 diabetes** due to the close association between **cardiovascular health** and **insulin resistance**. Understanding this relationship helps in the **early identification of at-risk individuals**, and interventions focused on improving **cardiovascular health** could help in managing both heart disease and diabetes simultaneously.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Gender**: The analysis of gender shows the distribution of diabetes cases between male and female individuals, helping to understand the **gender-specific diabetes prevalence**.\n- **Smoking History**: A significant association might be observed between smoking and diabetes risk. This analysis will help identify **smoking cessation** as a potential intervention to lower diabetes risk.\n- **Hypertension**: The presence of hypertension is strongly correlated with an increased risk of diabetes. This relationship underlines the importance of monitoring both conditions together and providing comprehensive care for patients.\n- **Heart Disease**: Heart disease is another important risk factor that often co-occurs with diabetes. Analyzing this feature highlights the need for **joint interventions** in patients with both conditions to improve health outcomes.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\nThe bivariate analysis of categorical features with diabetes status reveals critical insights into the factors that contribute to the risk of developing **diabetes**. By understanding how features such as **Gender**, **Smoking History**, **Hypertension**, and **Heart Disease** are related to diabetes, healthcare providers can implement more targeted **preventive measures**, provide **early interventions**, and develop **personalized treatment plans** for individuals at risk.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Multivariate

Model Comparison and Performance Evaluation\n\nIn this section, we compare the performance of four machine learning models applied to the diabetes prediction task. The models evaluated are:\n\n1. **Logistic Regression**\n2. **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**\n3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier**\n4. **Random Forest Classifier**\n\n### Evaluation Metric\nThe primary metric used to evaluate model performance is **accuracy**, which represents the proportion of correctly predicted instances out of the total instances.\n\n### Model Performance\n\n- **Logistic Regression**:\n  - **Accuracy**: **95.8%**\n  - Logistic Regression is a widely used model for binary classification tasks. It performed well, achieving an accuracy of 95.8%. This result suggests that the model is able to correctly predict the diabetes status of most patients.\n\n- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**:\n  - **Accuracy**: **96.0%**\n  - The SVC model, which seeks to find the optimal hyperplane to separate the classes, slightly outperformed Logistic Regression with an accuracy of 96.0%. This indicates that SVC is highly effective for this classification problem.\n\n- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier**:\n  - **Accuracy**: **95.6%**\n  - The KNN classifier, which makes predictions based on the majority class of its nearest neighbors, achieved an accuracy of 95.6%. While slightly lower than Logistic Regression and SVC, this is still a strong performance.\n\n- **Random Forest Classifier**:\n  - **Accuracy**: **96.8%**\n  - The Random Forest model, which creates an ensemble of decision trees to make predictions, achieved the highest accuracy of 96.8%. This indicates that the model is highly robust and capable of capturing complex patterns in the data.\n\n### Summary of Model Performance\n\n| Model                    | Accuracy (%) |\n|--------------------------|--------------|\n| **Logistic Regression**   | 95.8         |\n| **SVC**                   | 96.0         |\n| **KNN**                   | 95.6         |\n| **Random Forest**         | 96.8         |\n\n### Conclusion\n- **Random Forest** achieved the highest accuracy among the four models, closely followed by **SVC** and **Logistic Regression**. \n- **KNN**, while slightly lower in performance, still performed well and could be a viable option for this task.\n- **Random Forest**'s superior performance suggests that the model effectively captures the complexities of the data, making it a strong choice for this diabetes prediction task.\n- Overall, these results indicate that **Random Forest** and **SVC** are the most suitable models for this dataset, with **Random Forest** being the top performer.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
